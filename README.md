# Spiral Hexagon Distance Calculator

I was challenged to programmatically determine the minimum distance between hexagons numbered in a spiral as shown below. I decided to accomplish this in C, which I didn't know before now. This was my first "low level" language, and this project taught me a lot about memory, pointers, addresses, and of course, hexagon geometry.
